# Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline
An end-to-end data pipeline for customer churn prediction, utilizing modern data engineering and machine learning tools to automate data processes and improve prediction accuracy.

### Overview
This project is designed to predict customer churn by implementing an automated data pipeline that handles data ingestion, processing, transformation, and machine learning model training. The pipeline leverages:
- Python for scripting and general-purpose programming.
- Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration.
- dbt (Data Build Tool) for data transformations and modeling.
- PostgreSQL as the relational database.
- PyTorch for building and training machine learning models.

### Features
- Automated Data Pipeline: Uses Apache Airflow to automate daily data ingestion, processing, quality checks, and error handling.
- Modular Data Transformations: Employs dbt for version-controlled and modular SQL transformations to engineer machine learning features.
- Advanced Machine Learning Pipeline: Implements cross-validation, model training, and automated retraining using PyTorch.
- Neural Network Architectures: Utilizes advanced neural networks to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Scalable and Maintainable: Designed following best practices for scalability and ease of maintenance.
